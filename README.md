# Issue Tracker

This repository holds a simplified implementation of an issue tracker. I use this repo to learn 
new tech, new design patterns, and other ideas I wish to try. This README will contain info about 
running the system and any other documentation that doesn't belong in one of the lifecycle docs 
described below.

## Docs

I've created a series of docs to better plan and implement what I want to accomplish in this project. 
Here is a list and links to the documents and a short description.

1. [SRS](docs/srs.md) - Software requirements for the system. The what needs to be built and definition of done.
2. [SAD](docs/sad.md) - Software architecture for the system. How the system gets built.
